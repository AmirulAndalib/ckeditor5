The Widget feature implements the default handling for `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` to navigate nested editable elements in the editor content.
The listeners are registered on the `low` priority bubbling event in the context of widgets and editable elements. 
Please verify if your custom `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` handling does not collide with the default one.
