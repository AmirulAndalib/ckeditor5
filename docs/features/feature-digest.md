        The Read-Only Mode feature enables content to be locked from editing
        while still allowing it to be viewed. This mode is often used for
        restricting editing access based on user roles, allowing only specific
        users or groups to view the content without being able to modify it.
        Common uses include viewing sensitive documents like financial reports,
        software logs, or copyrighted stories that should not be altered but
        need to be accessible for copying or by screen readers. This mode can be
        toggled on and off by system triggers.

        The Text Part Language feature allows users to specify the language of
        individual sections of text. This capability helps in creating documents
        that include multiple languages by ensuring that browsers and screen
        readers correctly interpret each part according to its designated
        language. This feature is particularly valuable for content that
        contains text in varying directions, such as an English document with
        Arabic citations. It supports the WCAG 3.1.2 Language of Parts
        specification, facilitating the creation of more accessible and
        comprehensible multilingual content.
