<!-- Update as you see fit -->

CKEditor&nbsp;5 consists of {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds ready-to-use editor builds} and {@link framework/index CKEditor&nbsp;5 Framework} upon which the builds are based.

The easiest way to use CKEditor&nbsp;5 in your React application is by choosing one of the {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds#available-builds rich text editor builds}. Additionally, it is also possible to integrate [CKEditor&nbsp;5 built from source](#integrating-ckeditor-5-built-from-source) into your application. You can also use a customized editor built by using [CKEditor&nbsp;5 online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/) in any React application.

<info-box hint>
	Starting from version 6.0.0 of this package, you can use native type definitions provided by CKEditor&nbsp;5. Check the details about {@link installation/working-with-typescript TypeScript support}.
