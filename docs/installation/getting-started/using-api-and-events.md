# API and Events

CKEditor 5 and its plugins expose structured API and Events that are allowing to interact with an editor and to react to changes.

## Using the API

The API allows you to do multiple things with the editor and its content:

```js
editor.model.change((writer) => {
	// Move selection to the end of the document.
	writer.setSelection(
		writer.createPositionAt(editor.model.document.getRoot(), "end")
	);

	// Execute the enter command.
	editor.execute("enter");

	// Insert text.
	editor.model.change((writer) => {
		editor.model.insertContent(writer.createText("The End!"));
	});
});
```

In the example above, you use a selection, a command, and you change the content using the editor's model. All of this could be reverted with one undo step. This is a simple example of what the API can do.

Check more {@link examples/how-tos#editors-api examples}, {@link framework/architecture/core-editor-architecture CKEditor 5 core architecture} , and {@link api/index API reference}.

## Using events

An editor instance can also be used to set up listeners for events. Every plugin in the editor publishes events that you can subscribe to and interact with. For example, the {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change:data `Document#change:data`} event is fired when the document changes in such a way that is "visible" in the editor data:

```js
editor.model.document.on( "change:data", () => {
	console.log( "The data has changed!" );
} );
```

Events could be used to alter the behavior of the editor. Imagine a user wants to swap the <kbd>Enter</kbd> with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>, so <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> will insert a new block, while <kbd>Enter</kbd> will insertÂ a `<br>`.

```js
editor.editing.view.document.on( 'enter', ( evt, data ) => {
    data.preventDefault();
    evt.stop();

    if ( data.isSoft ) {
            editor.execute( 'enter' );
            editor.editing.view.scrollToTheSelection();

            return;
    }

    editor.execute( 'shiftEnter' );
    editor.editing.view.scrollToTheSelection();
}, { priority: 'high' } );
```
