# Frequently asked questions

## How to use CKEditor 5 with frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, etc.)?

For the list of official integrations, see the {@link installation/integrations/overview#official-wysiwyg-editor-integrations "Official integrations"} section.

If an official integration for the framework of your choice does not exist yet, read the {@link installation/integrations/overview "Integrating CKEditor 5 with JavaScript frameworks"} guide. CKEditor 5 offers a rich JavaScript API and predefined builds that make it possible to use CKEditor 5 with whichever framework you need.

We plan to provide more official integrations with time. [Your feedback on what we should work on next](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1002) will be most welcome!

## How to get a full-featured editor build?

We have prepared a build containing almost all available plugins, and it is called the superbuild. Read how to integrate it in the {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start#running-a-full-featured-editor-from-cdn quick start guide}.

In the {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds predefined builds} guide, there are details available about the {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds#superbuild superbuild}, together with the {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds#list-of-plugins-included-in-the-ckeditor-5-predefined-builds list of features included in the superbuild}, compared to other types of builds.

### How to turn the source mode on?

The {@link features/source-editing source editing} feature provides basic support for viewing and editing the source of the document.
