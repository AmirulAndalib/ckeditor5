## Quick start

### Using CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder

The easiest way to use CKEditor&nbsp;5 in your Vue application is by configuring it with [CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder](https://ckeditor.com/builder?redirect=docs) and integrating it with your application. Builder offers an easy-to-use user interface to help you configure, preview, and download the editor suited to your needs. You can easily select:

* the features you need,
* the preferred framework (React, Angular, Vue or Vanilla JS),
* the preferred distribution method.

You get ready-to-use code tailored to your needs!

### Setting up the project

This guide assumes that you already have a Vue project. If you do not have one, see the [Vue documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start) to learn how to create it.
