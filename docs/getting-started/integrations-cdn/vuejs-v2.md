<info-box warning>
	This guide is about the CKEditor&nbsp;5 integration with Vue.js 2.x. However, Vue 2 has reached EOL and is no longer actively maintained. To learn more about the integration with Vue.js 3+, check out the {@link getting-started/integrations/vuejs-v3 "Rich text editor component for Vue.js 3+"} guide.

Vue.js is a versatile framework for building web user interfaces. CKEditor&nbsp;5 provides the official Vue component you can use in your application.

<info-box>
	The {@link features/watchdog watchdog feature} is available for the {@link getting-started/integrations/react React} and {@link getting-started/integrations/angular Angular} integrations, but is not supported in Vue yet.

## Quick start

### Using CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder

The easiest way to use CKEditor 5 in your Vue application is by configuring it with [CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder](https://ckeditor.com/builder?redirect=docs) and integrating it with your application. Builder offers an easy-to-use user interface to help you configure, preview, and download the editor suited to your needs. You can easily select:

* the features you need,
* the preferred framework (React, Angular, Vue or Vanilla JS),
* the preferred distribution method.

You get ready-to-use code tailored to your needs!
