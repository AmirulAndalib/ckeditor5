# Usage-based billing

Usage-Based Billing (UBB) means the cost you incur depends on how much you use the TinyMCE editor.

##  How it works

We offer {@link getting-started/licensing/plans several pricing plans for commercial users}. Each of these plans includes a specific number of editor loads.

<info-box info>
	An editor load is a term used for each time CKEditor&nbsp;5 is loaded. For example, if 100 users load CKEditor 10 times each, there are 1,000 editor loads.
</info-box>

The number of editor loads needed depends on your application, however, all our plans have been developed to take into consideration actual use on our cloud infrastructure.

If you require additional editor loads, you have the option to upgrade to a more suitable plan or pay for every block of 1,000 editor loads over your allocated plan limit.
