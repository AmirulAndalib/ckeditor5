# Usage-based billing

Usage-Based Billing (UBB) means the cost you incur depends on how much you use CKEditor&nbsp;5.

##  How it works

<info-box>
	The information below is only valid for cloud-based users.

The billing is based on the number of editor loads. An editor load is a term used for each time CKEditor&nbsp;5 is initialized in your application. For example, if 100 users load CKEditor 10 times each, there are 1,000 editor loads. The number of editor loads needed depends on your application, however, all our plans have been developed to take into consideration actual use on our cloud infrastructure.

We offer several pricing plans for commercial users. Each of these plans includes a specific number of editor loads. If you require additional editor loads, you have the option to upgrade to a more suitable plan or pay for every block of 1,000 editor loads over your allocated plan limit.

Your billing month starts the day after your trial ends. For example, if the last day of your trial is June 2nd, we start counting your monthly editor loads on June 3rd, and then reset that count to 0 every 3rd day of each subsequent month.
