# (Legacy) React rich text editor component

<info-box warning>
	⚠️  We changed installation methods and this legacy guide is kept for users' convenience. If you are looking for current CKEditor 5 React integration, please refer to the newest version of the {@link getting-started/integrations/react-default-npm CKEditor&nbsp;5 integration} guide.
</info-box>

This integration used a predefined builds approach. Predefined CKEditor&nbsp;5 builds were a set of ready-to-use rich text editors. As of April, 2025 this method of installation has been discontinued. Please refer to the {@link getting-started/integrations-cdn/quick-start Quick Start} guide to choose one of the modern installation and integration methods available.
