# Vue.js 3+ rich text editor component &ndash; Legacy guide

<info-box warning>
	⚠️  We changed installation methods and this legacy guide was previously kept for users' convenience. As of April, 2025 integrations based on predefined builds are no longer supported. Please refer to the {@link getting-started/index#ckeditor-5-framework-integrations Quick Start} guide to choose one of the modern installation and integration methods available and {@link updating/nim-migration/migration-to-new-installation-methods migrate to new installation methods}.
