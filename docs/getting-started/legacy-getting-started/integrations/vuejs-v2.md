This integration used a predefined builds approach. Predefined CKEditor&nbsp;5 builds were a set of ready-to-use rich text editors. As of April, 2025 this method of installation has been discontinued. Please refer to the {@link getting-started/integrations-cdn/quick-start Quick Start} guide to choose one of the modern installation and integration methods available.
