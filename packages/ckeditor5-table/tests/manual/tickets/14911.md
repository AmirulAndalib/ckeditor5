# Ticket test: [#14911](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14911)

Tables are changed.

## Table 1

CKEditor has moved the parent row for "Rowgroup Header 1" into the thead element, which makes the table inaccessible to screen readers.

## Table 2

CKEditor has moved all the parent rows for rowgroup headers into the thead element. It has also put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block. This makes the table inaccessible to screen readers and is a loss of data, since we can no longer reconstruct the original table due to loss of the tbody blocks.

## Table 3

CKEditor has not moved all the parent rows for rowgroup headers into the thead element, but has put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block. This causes data loss, since we can no longer reconstruct the original table due to loss of the tbody blocks, and makes the table inaccessible to screen readers. CKEditor has also turned row headers in the second column to td elements with a scope attribute, which is invalid, and causes further accessibility issues.

## Table 4

CKEditor has added inline styles to col elements (strange), put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block (again, potential data loss and makes the table inaccessible to screen readers). I'm not sure what the practical implications of this next quirk are, but I want to note it. CKEditor has added a non-breaking space character to an empty th tag. I don't think non-breaking spaces are ASCII whitespace. This means that the header cell is non-empty and user agents (including screen readers) should add it to the header list for the cells beneath it, according to the spec.

## Table 5

If you copy/paste the table example from Curriculum for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (created in year 2000!) into the CKEditor 5 demo page (via the Source mode button) it is broken.

It appears that several things are happening:

* multiple `<tbody>` sections are collapsed into a single one.
* any `<tr>` in `<tbody>` consisting of only `<th>` tags (no `<td>` tags) are considered by CKEditor to be a header, and thus pulled out of order up into the `<thead>` section.
