## Emoji plugin

This test allows for testing of both `EmojiMention` and `EmojiPicker` plugins.

### EmojiPicker

EmojiPicker plugin can be accessed via the main toolbar button, as well as the menu bar under `Insert > Emoji`

### EmojiMention

EmojiMention plugin allows by inserting emoji directly via typing. To test it, write the default marker `:` followed by at least first two letters of desired emoji. Make sure to include at least one space before the marker, otherwise the mention plugin does not kick in. Then, you can either choose which emoji to insert, or choose the last option: `Show all emoji...` to open the `EmojiPicker` plugin, which should then have the same text in its search bar.
